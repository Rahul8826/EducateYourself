                opportunity to make positive changes. Now is the time to change how we think, trying new things that we
                have always been told were impossible because systems are so deeply entrenched. These excuses no longer
                hold. Practically every system has been thrown into a state of upheaval. People may soon be ready to
                reconsider certain ideas that have been dismissed in the past.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">One of the systems that are undergoing rapid change is education. In the
                current crisis, it is becoming increasingly clear that the purpose of education is not simply to gather
                information that is already available. Education is about honing the skills of critical thinking and
                analysis. It is about lifelong learning, and about helping children become self-driven learners. One of
                the ways to achieve that goal is to foster a love of reading from the earliest years of a child’s life –
                indeed, even in the womb.</p>
